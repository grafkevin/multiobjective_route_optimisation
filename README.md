# Comparing 3 different evolutionary algorithms to solve a three-objective TSP
This code optimises a three-objective traveling salesman problem (TSP). Three different multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are used to solve this problem. The applied MOEAs are NSGA-II, MOEA/D, and IBEA which were taken from the Platypus framework. The performances of the three algorithms are compared through their hypervolume indicator. In the end, the cheapest, the fastest, and the greenest routes are plotted on a world map.
